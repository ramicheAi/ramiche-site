# ramiche-site (Automation Dock)

Local-first “automation dock” UI for Ramon/Ramiche.

## Principles
- Nothing auto-publishes.
- The dock should surface: Today’s priorities, queues, drafts, PRs, and “while-you-slept” summaries.

## Dev
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Planned features (initial)
- Status cards: GA launch, Printful queue, Shopify build-out checklist
- Links hub (Weavy flow, GA asset vault paths, Printful product links)
- Draft generator surfaces (copy templates, naming helpers)
